TLDR; "Shipping first" mentality is really useful in general, but it can be taken too far. You need to make sure you aren't sacrificing quality and the full potential of your project when trying to hit deadlines and release stuff.

This is a short post about something I've been thinking about a bit lately.

One of the most important skills any creative person needs to learn is how to ship projects.
Jumping from one unfinished project to another is not always bad, it can teach you a lot.
However at some point you really want to try show off your work to other people, this way you can understand perspective of others and get really useful feedback.

By finishing your projects you are also forced to understand the _entire_ process of developing a game/app, not just the first few steps.
This is one of the reason the number one advice to beginner game developers is to participate in game jams, where you have to finish a game in a few days, or limit the scope of your first project.
In general finishing many small projects can teach you a lot, and depending on your approach it can be far more useful than spending all that time on a single big project.
There are well known stories about the OG game developers developing many many small games before they made their first hit. I think John Romero mentioned a challenge where he made a game
for every single letter in the alphabet, which is really cool and I'm sure it made him into a much better developer.

I think this advice still makes sense for most people, because not shipping and getting lost during the development of a over ambitious project is by far the most common issue I see.
Those issues might also be to related to [Derek Yu's Death loops](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/deathloops.html), however not being focused enough on the final product and not shipping is still the fundamental issue IMO.

But there are downsides.

I think I first heard about some of the similar negative effects of this mindset from Jonathan Blow few years ago.
He criticised the common advice to stop being ambitious and reduce scope of your first projects.
