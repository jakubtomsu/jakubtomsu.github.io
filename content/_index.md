Hey, I'm Jakub! I really like the technical side of gamedev. I do hobby engine and graphics programming, with focus on high-performance, data-oriented code.

I use [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) and occasionally C/C++/ISPC for most of my personal projects.

## Solar Storm
Currently I'm working on [Solar Storm](https://jakubtomsu.github.io/solarstorm), a retro artillery game set in space.
