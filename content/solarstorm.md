# Solar Storm

Solar Storm is a classic turn-based artillery shooter. You are a tank pilot, fighting for control over the solar system. Battle your friends in a fully destructible terrain to see who is the best!

The game is made in the [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) programming language, with a custom game engine built with the help of [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol).
